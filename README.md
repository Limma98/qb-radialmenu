Radial Menu Used With QB-Core :arrows_counterclockwise:

**Now using FontAwesome Icons!**
To change icons get the name from [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/v5.0/icons?d=gallery&p=2&s=brands,light,regular,solid&m=free) (v5) and use the icon's name in the config.lua for the icon (no `fa-` or `#` just the name like `arrow-right`)
